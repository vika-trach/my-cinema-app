# ðŸŽ¬ Cinema app ðŸŽ¬
This is a RESTful web application that mimics a movie service. Its features include buying tickets, searching for available movies for rent, checking purchase history, and user registration and verification. Moreover, the app includes role-based categorization for users.

## Project Structure
Cinema app project follows a three-tier architecture with the following structure:

* Controller: Handles incoming requests from user and admin and invokes the appropriate service methods.
* Service: Implements the business logic of the application and interacts with the DAO layer.
* DAO: Transfers requests from the service layer to the database, and executes SQL queries.
* Project also has logic of identification, authentication, authorization, filtration and encoding realized by Spring which provides additional security of user data
## User Access Endpoints
* POST: /register (create a user)
* POST: /orders/complete (create an order for the current user)
* PUT: /shopping-carts/movie-sessions (add a movie session to the shopping cart)
* GET: /orders (get order history for the current user)
* GET: /shopping-carts/by-user (get a shopping cart for the current user)
* GET: /cinema-halls (get all cinema halls)
* GET: /movies (get all movies)
* GET: /movie-sessions/available (get all available movies by date)
## Admin Access Endpoints
*   POST: /cinema-halls (create a cinema hall)
*   POST: /movies (create a movie)
*   POST: /movie-sessions (create a movie session)
*   PUT: /movie-sessions/{id} (update a movie session)
*   DELETE: /movie-sessions/{id} (delete a movie session)
*   GET: /users/by-email (find a user by email)

 All endpoints send and receive JSON data, except for the login page, which is generated by Spring Security. Almost all endpoints are secured by role-based authorization. More details can be found in the SecurityConfig class.
